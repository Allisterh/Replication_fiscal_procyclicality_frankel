Repository for the project: replicating the paper by Frankel, Végh &
Vuletin (2011).

### Description of this project

This projects follows Frankel, Végh & Vuletin (2011) in most regards but
it is not identical. Main difference are: I use a much smaller set of
countries - mostly rich, industrialized nations and some latin american
countries; I won’t use the International Country Risk Guide in order to
include a meaasure of institutional quality, but I will include
variables from the Polity and the Polconv projects instead.

### The Data

The main data source is the World Economic Outlook database published by
the IMF on a biannual basis. Also, some data from other sources are
included. Mainly, I used a free sample from the International Country
Risk Guide which, although lacking most years, contained enough data to
replicate and explore the important features of the paper.

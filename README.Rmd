Repository for the project: replicating the paper by Frankel, Végh & Vuletin (2011).

This projects follows Frankel, Végh & Vuletin (2011) in most regards but it is not identical. Main difference are: I use a much smaller set of countries - mostly rich, industrialized nations and some latin american countries; I won't use the International Country Risk Guide in order to include a meaasure of institutional quality, but I will include variables from the Polity and the Polconv projects instead.
